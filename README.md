# OnlineMobileBillingSystemBasedOnJSP

It was the extension of my first project 'Mobile billing System', which was in Core Java. Here I created it in JSP and it have both client and server side.

## Installation

Best way to use it to add it as a new project within Netbeans. As it is a online project, it require server (any server which can support JSP).
